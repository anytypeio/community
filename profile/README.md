## Code of Conduct

This document outlines the expectations of everyone in the Anytype open-source project and community. We invite all those who participate in helping us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. We are home to a diverse community that shares our values of joy, hope, and optimism about the future. Communities often mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and power abuses.

#### How to behave :

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate authentically and actively. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. Remember, we have all been through different stages of learning when adopting new technologies.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.
- Disagreements are fine; argumentative behaviour or trolling is not.

#### How not to behave :

- Do not perform threats of violence or use violent language directed against another person.
- Refrain from sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory, or use language of this nature.
- Do not post or display sexually explicit or violent material.
- Do not post or threaten to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Do not make personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Do not engage in sexual attention. This includes sexualised comments or jokes and sexual advances.
- Do not advocate for, or encourage, any of the above behaviour.

Please take into account that online communities bring together people from many different cultures and backgrounds. It’s important to understand that sometimes the combination of cultural differences and online interaction can lead to misunderstandings. That is why having empathy is very important.

#### How to report issues :

If someone is misbehaving or violating this Code of Conduct and are not receptive to your feedback, or you prefer not to engage, please reach out to Anytype via community@anytype.io.

#### Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour :

We do not tolerate unacceptable behaviour from any community member. If asked, we expect a community member acting in contradiction to these guidelines to stop immediately. Both Anytype and the community may take appropriate action, including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community.
